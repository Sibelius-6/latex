title: Controlling Sqrt

After I changed to a new font for the whole document, it also affects math font. So now $j$ becomes extremely long, and when `\sqrt` wants to adapt to its size, the result is not that good...

You can clearly see the difference for $i$ and $j$...

After some search, I found [this](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/121402/the-size-of-roots). However, this won't directly solve my problem. Then I combined two of his ideas:

```latex
\norm{\theta}_F = \sqrt{\smash[b]{\sum_{j} \theta_j^2} \vphantom{\sum_i}}
```

- `\vphantom` has the height and depth of its argument, but its width is zero (from [tutorialspoint](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tex_commands/vphantom.htm)).
- `\smash` takes its contents and prints it as if its height and depth were zero (from [stackexchange](https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/424200/what-does-smash-do-and-where-is-it-documented)).

Hence this is a really weird solution but it works like a charm.
