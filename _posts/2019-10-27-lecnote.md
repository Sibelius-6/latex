title: LaTeX Lecture Notes Template
tags: template
---

Since cross references in lecture notes are important, I created a template for theorem/lemma/proposition... blocks with beamer skin and proof/remark... blocks and equation block. You can see the result and the LaTeX code via [here](https://github.com/Sibelius-6/class-note-template).

Check the [follow-up blog](/2021/12/31/lecnote2.html).
