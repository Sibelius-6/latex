title: MUSIC 254 Listening Assignment
tags: template
---

Since we were impacted by COVID-19 [this term](https://notes.sibeliusp.com/term/1201), in [MUSIC 254](https://notes.sibeliusp.com/music/254) the listening quizzes and listening portion from the final exam were merged into this big listening assignment. We were allowed to be creative: letter, a series of texts... as long as we mentioned the info of three pieces.

Here I used *chat history* template from [here](https://tex.stackexchange.com/a/239511). I also made some minor changes to it. I planned to draw WeChat, but it seemed to be too much work...

Here is my first page:

I drew the wifi icon (via `\usepackage{fontawesome}`) and Fido on the top left. Also here, I tried to simulate the youtube share message:
